# Use-Singleton-Class-Object

An experimental code challenge to really push the limits of TypeScript and React.

If you can do it, it unblocks a lot of potential for a _mixed-paradigm_ React codebase that features a _functional_ main render pipeline that hooks into _object-oriented_ classes for managing complex state and business logic.

Get creative!

## Getting Started

1. Install Bun (bun.sh).
2. Run `bun install`.
3. Run `bun dev`.
4. Check out the app at `http://localhost:5173`.
5. Make your changes in `src/use-singleton-object/`. Look for `TODO`s.
